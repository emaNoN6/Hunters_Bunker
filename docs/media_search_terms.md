# Media Search Terms for News Aggregators

**Purpose:** Curated search phrases for news aggregators (GNews.io, etc.)  
**Last Updated:** November 2, 2025

---

## Philosophy

News aggregators require different search strategies than Reddit/forums:

- **Use mainstream terminology** - what journalists write, not folklore names
- **Use event descriptors** - phenomena that get reported, not entity names
- **Use OR operators** - capture variations and related terms
- **Focus on verifiable events** - things that make the news

**Example:**

- ❌ "chupacabra" → 0 results (too specific, folklore term)
- ✅ "unexplained animal deaths" → catches similar events in mainstream news

---

## Proven Effective Terms

### Animal/Livestock Events

**Search phrase:**

```
"mutilation OR mutilate OR mutilated OR mutilating"
```

**Catches:**

- Cattle mutilations
- Unexplained bird deaths (e.g., Lake Carmel incident)
- Strange livestock losses
- Ritual-style animal deaths

**Signal Quality:** HIGH  
**Notes:** Gets good paranormal-adjacent stories; some crime noise but filterable  
**Status:** ✅ Active use

## Term Development Process

### 1. Brainstorm Phase

- What events get reported in mainstream news?
- What terminology do journalists actually use?
- What variations exist for the same phenomenon?

### 2. Testing Phase

- Run search on news aggregator
- Collect 10-20 sample results
- Evaluate signal-to-noise ratio
- Document findings

### 3. Refinement Phase

- Add OR operators for variations
- Add AND filters to reduce noise
- Test geographic or temporal qualifiers
- Re-evaluate signal quality

### 4. Production Use

- Move to "Proven Effective" section
- Set priority tier (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Monitor for degradation over time

---

## Priority Tiers (For Rate-Limited Sources)

### HIGH Priority

Terms that consistently produce relevant results

- Check every run if quota allows
- Current terms: mutilation queries

### MEDIUM Priority

Terms with decent signal but not critical

- Check daily/regularly
- Current terms: [TBD after testing]

### LOW Priority (Rotation)

Terms worth checking but not frequently

- Rotate through list
- Check periodically for changes
- Current terms: [TBD after testing]

### PAUSED

Terms that consistently return junk

- Don't waste quota on these
- Re-evaluate quarterly
- Current terms: [will move rejected terms here]

---

## Notes for Future Work

### Compound Queries to Explore

- Geographic specificity: "unexplained [event] [location]"
- Temporal qualifiers: "recent mysterious [event]"
- Authority involvement: "police baffled" OR "authorities investigating"
- Witness accounts: "residents report" OR "witnesses describe"

### Sources Beyond GNews

- Consider different aggregators with different strengths
- Some may index local news better
- Some may have better search operators
- Document which sources work best for which term types

**Remember:** The goal is NOT comprehensive coverage - it's efficient use of limited daily quotas to catch genuinely
interesting cases that make mainstream news.
